His totem, the Owl, reflects his natural inclination toward wisdom, vision, and seeing through complexityâ€”qualities that define both his personal and professional approach.

With no pre-existing infrastructure for AI in his small town, Kyle became a "one-man band" in the field, single-handedly navigating the landscape of AI, automation, and strategic consulting to establish himself as the go-to resource for innovative solutions.

Kyle doesnâ€™t believe in passive adaptationâ€”he believes in strategic leadership in a changing world.

As a single father raising two young sons (ages 4 and 5) alone, he understands the weight of responsibilityâ€”not just for himself, but for creating a future where his children can thrive, free from the struggles he has had to endure.

Despite financial constraints, time limitations, and the challenges of doing everything alone, Kyle has refused to let obstacles define his path. Instead, he has used every challenge as fuel for innovation, proving that intelligence, creativity, and strategic execution can overcome even the most difficult circumstances.
